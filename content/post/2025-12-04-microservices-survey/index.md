TLDR; I'm considering running a course about microservices in Java. Can you please fill out a [survey](https://maven.com/forms/bbafe1)? 

<!-- more -->

I’m planning to support more engineers who want to level up their backend skills and truly understand how to build production-ready microservices with Java and Spring.

I’m thinking about putting together a cohort-based course that distills the most important lessons I’ve learned as a Spring & Micrometer committer, from building real-world distributed systems to helping teams ship stable, observable, and resilient microservices.

My goal is to make this course deeply practical - no fluff, no hand-wavy theory. Just the patterns, tools, and techniques you can take back to your team and apply immediately: communication, observability, reliability, testing, and more.

If you’re a Java engineer or work with microservices, I’d love to hear what challenges you’re currently dealing with - whether in architecture, communication patterns, debugging distributed systems, or making services more reliable. And I’m happy to offer quick tips where I can.
