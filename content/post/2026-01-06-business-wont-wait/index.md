If you’re building microservices, working with Spring, or collaborating with infra or platform teams, this will give you useful context and a shared language for those conversations.

Speaking of which, my new [Java Microservices with Spring workshops](https://maven.com/toomuchcoding/java-microservices-with-spring) are available for enrollment on [Maven](https://maven.com/toomuchcoding/java-microservices-with-spring).

The course is battle-proven, I've been doing it for years through the O'Reilly platform, and I've taught **hundreds of students**. So if you want to learn how to work with microservices, Spring Cloud, Micrometer and more, this is the course for you!

**Remember that the discount is valid until January 11th** - with the promo code **TOOMUCHCODING** you can get **$200** discount on the course, [so hurry up](https://maven.com/toomuchcoding/java-microservices-with-spring)!
