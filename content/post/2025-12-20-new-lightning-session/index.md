A few days ago I announced that my **Java Microservices with Spring** workshops are live.

<!-- more -->

If you missed it, you can read the full announcement [here](https://toomuchcoding.com/post/2025-12-17-new-course-is-live/).

Today I’d like to share something related, but different in form.

I’ve just published a **lightning session** called  
**“Business won’t wait, the platform won’t either”**.

This is not a technical deep dive and not an IDP tutorial.  
It’s a short talk about *why* even well-built systems, including Spring-based microservices, often fail to deliver business value when infrastructure and platform concerns are treated as a cost center or a gate.

In the session I talk about:
- why infra teams struggle to be seen as partners
- what usually breaks at scale, even with good code
- what has to change for platforms to actually enable teams

If you’re building microservices, working with Spring, or collaborating with infra or platform teams, this will give you useful context and a shared language for those conversations.

You can find the lightning session [free registration page here](https://maven.com/p/d2e0b7/business-won-t-wait-the-platform-won-t-either).
