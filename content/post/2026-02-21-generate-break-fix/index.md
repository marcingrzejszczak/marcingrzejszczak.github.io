I'm running a new workshop on related to AI and distributed systems. You can check it out [here](https://maven.com/toomuchcoding/generate-break-fix-distributed-systems-in-the-ai-era).

I've successfully delivered my last [Java Microservices with Spring](https://maven.com/toomuchcoding/java-microservices-with-spring) workshop for about 10 people. From the feedback I received, the students were really enjoying it. However, I've decided to give the workshop more thought since I created it a couple of years ago, when people were still using IDEs to code...

AI, AI, AI... AI is everywhere! In my [TooMuchCoding Newsletter](https://toomuchcoding.com/subscribe/), I have a separate section dedicated to AI. People want AI. People want to learn how to use AI in such a way that they don't generate AI slop but valuable piece of code.

I've been using AI extensively for the last couple of months. I'm not saying that I'm a Claude Code or Codex expert, some things are still new to me, and that's fine. However, I do know how to use AI to generate code that works well with distributed systems...

This is why I'm running a new workshop on distributed systems in the AI called [Generate, Break, Fix: Distributed Systems in the AI Era](https://maven.com/toomuchcoding/generate-break-fix-distributed-systems-in-the-ai-era). The idea is that you take your favourite code generation tool, and you use it to generate code. We'll see how well the code works, we'll try to break it. Most likely we will, and then we'll fix it! The infamous TDD cycle will be repeated on the AI level (OK, maybe the TDD cycle looked a little bit different, but you get the idea 😀). 

I need your help to make this workshop a success! If you're interested, please fill out the [survey](https://maven.com/forms/e8d298).
