I'm happy to announce that I've started a newsletter! 

I'm planning to keep you up to date with my latest projects and articles. I'm typically writing a bigger article every 1-2 months and some smaller ones now and then. That means that I'm not planning to spam you with too many emails 😀.

You can subscribe to the newsletter under this post or through [contact](/contact) or through the dedicated [newsletter](/subscribe) page.
