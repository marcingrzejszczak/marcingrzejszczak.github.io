## New Blog

I've decided to move away from Octopress to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It seems like Hugo is getting more and more traction, and I needed something simple to work with. Hugo with the [Blox](https://hugoblox.com/) layout seems super easy.

I will do my best to keep this blog more alive. I'm not planning to use AI to write posts so if there are any mistakes, please let me know. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/marcingrzejszczak.github.io/tree/main/content/post).

## Goodbye Spring, Hello Spring!

For the past almost 10 years I've been working for [Spring](https://spring.io) as a Senior Software Engineer. It was by far the best job I've ever had. I learned a lot from fantastic people, a lot of whom I can call close friends. However, I took a decision to move on.

I'm happy to say that I'm now working for [HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/) where I joined the team working with... Spring! So I will still be working with the best framework in the world 😀.

## Mentoring and Consulting

In the meantime I've decided to start offering [mentoring and consulting services](/consulting). I got over 30 free consultations (currently I have a pause - needed to take a break), and that resulted in having sessions with 8 mentees! I'm super happy with the conversations and the feedback. If you're interested in joining the group, go to my [consultation page](/consulting) and talk to me.

I also started doing consulting, and I have to admit that it's been a great experience. Recently I had pleasure to work with a team that was developing an Internal Developer Platform, and I was helping them build parts of the platform. 

If you or your company is interested in working with me, please go to my [consultation page](/consulting) and check out the options.

## Presentations and Workshops

I had the pleasure of giving a keynote at one of the internal company conferences in Poland. The talk was about Internal Developer Platforms, completely by accident related to my consulting work!

If you're interested in me giving a talk at your company events or conferences, please [contact me](/contact).
