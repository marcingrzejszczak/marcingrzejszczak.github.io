Welcome to another article about Spring Cloud Contract 5. Why so many articles recently? Because I finally had some time to work on that plus a major release is coming so there's a window of opportunity to change things right now!

#### The Problem

For the last couple of majors we were migrating the Gradle plugin to have its own source set for contract tests. With that we've provided a default folder for Gradle contract tests - `src/contractTest/resources/contracts`. The old folder structure (`src/test/resources/contracts`) was deprecated and shown warnings.

#### The Solution

With that [PR](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/pull/2307) the old folder structure checking is gone and your contracts will not be read from the `src/test/resources/contracts` location).

#### Conclusion

In this short article I've mentioned the most important breaking change related to code removal for the upcoming Spring Cloud Contract 5 release.
