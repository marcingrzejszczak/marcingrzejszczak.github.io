I'm happy to announce that my new workshops - Java Microservices with Spring - are live!

<!-- more -->

Due to lack of time and marketing experience, I was unable to properly promote this course last year even though there was quite a lot of interest. This time I've decided to play it by the book!

My new workshops are available for enrollment on [Maven](https://maven.com/toomuchcoding/java-microservices-with-spring). 

The course is battle-proven, I've been doing it for years through the O'Reilly platform, and I've taught hundreds of students. So if you want to learn how to work with microservices, Spring Cloud, Micrometer and more, this is the course for you!

Since Christmas is coming, why not make yourself a present? With the promo code **TOOMUCHCODING** you can get **$200** discount on the course! **The offer is valid until January 11th**, so hurry up!
