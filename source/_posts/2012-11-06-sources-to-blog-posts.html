<div class='post'>
I am happy to announce that I managed to find some time in order to create a repository for the code that I've been presenting here (at least for the most of it). You can find the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/gregorin1987/too-much-coding">Too Much Coding sources by clicking here</a> or type in the address&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/gregorin1987/too-much-coding">https://bitbucket.org/gregorin1987/too-much-coding</a>.<br /><br />Enjoy :)</div>
