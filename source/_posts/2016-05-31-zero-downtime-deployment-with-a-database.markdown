I've just published an article at the Spring blog about [Zero Downtime Deployment with a Database](
https://spring.io/blog/2016/05/31/zero-downtime-deployment-with-a-database). So if you're planning on doing
zero downtime or blue/green deployment you'd better check out that article :) The code is available here on
[Github](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/zero-downtime-deployment).
