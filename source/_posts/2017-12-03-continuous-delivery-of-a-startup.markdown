Hi!

After a very long pause, finally I've managed to write a new blog post. It's an interview with [Jakub Kubry≈Ñski](https://twitter.com/jkubrynski) about Continuous Delivery of a Startup. It's published as part of the [Java Advent Calendar](https://www.javaadvent.com/2017/12/cd-of-a-startup.html).

Check it out [here!](https://www.javaadvent.com/2017/12/cd-of-a-startup.html).
