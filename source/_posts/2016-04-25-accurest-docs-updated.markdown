After a lot of sleepless nights I've finally migrated the [Accurest Docs](https://codearte.github.io/accurest/) from Github's Wiki to Asciidoctor.
With that change the vast majority of our snippets is taken from the tests. Also thanks to that change it will be much easier to keep the docs up to date
since the documentation lives together with the code.

Quite frankly recently when I didn't code [Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth) I did a lot around [Accurest](https://codearte.github.io/accurest/) and messaging so stay tuned! For sure there will be a new post about Consumer Driven Contracts and Messaging.
