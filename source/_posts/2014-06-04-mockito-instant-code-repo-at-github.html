Hi!<br /><br />Since I was asked for the code to the<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/how-to-create-stubs-mocks-spies-using-mockito/book"> "Mockito Instant"</a> book a couple of times I decided to place it on Github. Here is the link - <a href="https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/mockito-instant">https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/mockito-instant</a>. Enjoy :)</div>
