I'm more than happy to announce that I've finally migrated from Blogspot to a decent
blogging technology - Octopress! Thanks to [Tomek Dziurko](http://tomaszdziurko.pl/) who
was the one that suggested to choose that technology.

Also as you can see I've finally bought a domain for the *Too Much Coding blog* which is
[https://toomuchcoding.com](https://toomuchcoding.com). I don't even know why I'm
writing it since you can see the address in your browser ;) You can also send me an email
at *blog (at) toomuchcoding.com*.

Even though initially I had some doubts about choosing Octopress I have to admit that
it seems like an awesome technology and you should definitely give it a try!

P.S.
We're looking for sponsors for the upcoming [Warsaw GR8 Day Conference](http://warsaw.gr8days.pl) (19.03.2016).
Over 60 people have already registered! Contact us to be a part of this gr8 event!
