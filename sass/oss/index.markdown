Below you can find a list of my open source projects that I'm working on / I've created

- [Spring Cloud](https://github.com/spring-cloud) - mostly I'm working on [Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth), [Spring Cloud Contract](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract) and [Spring Cloud Pipelines](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines)
- [JSON Assert](https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/jsonassert) - fluent JSON assertions
- [XML Assert](https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/xmlassert) - fluent XML assertions
- [Spock Subjects Collaborators Extension](https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/spock-subjects-collaborators-extension) - @InjectMocks for Spock
- [Gradle Test Profiler](https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/gradle-test-profiler) - a Gradle plugin to profile your tests
- [Gradle Uptodate Plugin](https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/uptodate-gradle-plugin) - Gradle plugin to check if your code is up to date.

I've also contributed some code to

- [Groovy](https://github.com/apache/groovy) - I've done the basis of the [@Builder transform](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/main/groovy/transform/builder/ExternalStrategy.java)
- [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) - I've done some work on deep stubs (hopefully you shouldn't be using them!)
- [Rest-Assured](https://github.com/jayway/rest-assured) - the Async bit of Spring MVC (version 2.5.0)
- [Micro-Infra-Spring](https://github.com/4finance/micro-infra-spring) - a lot from that code is already in Spring. I'm not contributing to this repo anymore though.
- [Moco](https://github.com/dreamhead/moco) - [added GMoco support](https://github.com/dreamhead/moco/pull/45)
- [Accurest](https://github.com/Codearte/accurest) - Consumer Driven Contracts verifier for Java - predecessor of [Spring Cloud Contract](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract)
